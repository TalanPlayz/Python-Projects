# Python-Projects
This is a tutorial on how to make an AI from reinforcement learning. We are going to be using Python to code this AI, and the module we are using is the "[gym](https://github.com/openai/gym/)" module. You need a decent amount of storage to use this module as it
uses quite a bit of space to code.
